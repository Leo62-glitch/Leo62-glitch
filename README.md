🚀 AI Enthusiast | Creative Coder
Hi, I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, especially in fields like deep learning, generative models, and human-computer interaction. I enjoy building smart systems that can see, think, and even create.

🧠 I love experimenting with:

    Neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)

    Generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion)

    Natural language processing and computer vision

    Open-source projects and AI research prototypes

💡 I’m always learning, hacking, and sharing. Whether it’s building a real-time image classifier in TensorFlow.js, fine-tuning language models, or collaborating on creative AI tools, I thrive where code meets intelligence.

🔧 Technologies I often use:
Python · PyTorch · TensorFlow · Keras · Hugging Face

📬 Let’s connect! Feel free to check out my projects or reach out if you're interested in collaborating on cool AI stuff.
